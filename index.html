	<div><br><br><em>In 2016 winter.</em><br> I went to croatia with friend. The scenery there was so wonderful. Especially when I went to Dubrovnik, the appearance of the glow was really like a work. Also, the houses with red roofs on white walls were arranged so nicely. The second most memorable place was Split. I had seen Split in the TV program and wanted to go there and eat gelato. I also wanted to take pictures among beautifully lined trees. There were quite a lot of people enjoying coffee on a wide street. I was thinking that people in my country are really busy when I look at them. The last place to go in Croatia was Zadar with a sea organ. The sound of the sea organ we first heard was very impressive. I like to listen every time the waves hit, so if you have a chance, I would like to go one more time.

	<em>In 2016 winter.</em><br> In Bosnia, there were many vivid records of civil war. There are traces of bullets in the buildings that you see on the way, and you can see buildings that have collapsed. Catholic and Muslim peoples live together around the Neretva River in Bosnia. The bridge has a bridge, which was collapsed due to religious wars, rebuilt and now registered as a World Heritage Site. We took a picture in front of the bridge and I went down the river and touched the river by hand.
And I went to the old town and watched it, and I saw a big dog and greeted the people in the area, and I had a bit of a nervous but fun time.

 	<em>In 2012 winter.</em><br> I was very excited when I traveled to France. Because I could actually see the Eiffel Tower I wanted to see from my childhood, and I was able to listen to my favorite French pronunciation. Also, the French children were really beautiful and they kept looking up. We also built the street-side buildings classically and beautifully, and there were lots of cute little items on the street. I looked around several tourist attractions but the most beautiful of them was the Eiffel Tower and Montmartre Park. The night view of the Eiffel Tower by boat was so beautiful and the view to the top of the Eiffel Tower was perfect. And there was a lot of people taking a rest in Montmartre Park, but I was envious of the relaxed appearance.

	<em>In 2012 winter.</em><br> Italy is the best place I've ever visited Europe. I saw a movie in Rome on a bus going to Italy and it was so impressive. As the land of architecture, several buildings were lined up and the floor was also made up of small stones. What was interesting was that on the Roman holiday, Audrey Hepburn followed the scene of eating Gelato in the Trevi Fountain. And I am not interested in art so much, but after I traveled to Rome, I became interested in architecture. If it is my chance to come later, Rome will surely want to go again and travel freely.

	<em>In 2016 fall.</em><br> Last autumn I went to China to meet my younger brother. My brother started to live in China from early last year, but for a while he went to see his face and travel. In the meantime, my linguistic skills have increased so much that I have taken me around here to explain. I have been to China a few times when I was a child, but this is the first time I've ever been free. The most memorable thing I went to was the Beijing Zoo to see the Panda. I actually saw the panda so much bigger than I thought it was cute, so I took pictures and bought panda dolls. And for the first time alone, I was very proud of the experience of coming to Korea by hanging up my flight ticket in China.
