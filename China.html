		<div id="dt"> Tiananmen Square, famous as the world's largest plaza, is located in central Beijing. It is 800 meters long to the north and 500 meters long to the east and west, with a total area of 44,000 square meters. Tiananmen Square, a space that can accommodate more than a million people, is used as a venue for mass demonstrations, rallies, celebrations and processions in China. In the past, this place was a 'T' shaped court plaza, and it was a place where ordinary people could not get in until Cheongdae. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, it began to open, allowing limited access by civilians to events such as holidays. The most representative place of Tiananmen Square is Tianyuan Gate, which is the front gate of the Forbidden City, where the portraits are taken.
